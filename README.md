So named because I just gave up giving creative names to these themes.

CSS Naming Convention
---------------------

Pseudo BEM, SMACSS or whatever. Anyway.

**Block**: Unit of structure. Named as name of block.
**Element**: Unit of HTML. Named as `block__element`.
**Modifier**: Unit of state. Named as `block__element-modifier-state`.
**Page**: For page specific CSS. Named as `page--block__element`.

Yoast Breadcrumbs Recommended Configuration
-------------------------------------------
**Separator between breadcrumbs**: `>>`
**Anchor text for the Homepage**: `Home`
**Prefix for Archive breadcrumbs**: `Archives:`
**Prefix for Search Page breadcrumbs**: `Search:`
